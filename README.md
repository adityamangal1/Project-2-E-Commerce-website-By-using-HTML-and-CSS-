# E Commerce website By using HTML and CSS(Fully Responsive)

### A fully responsive website from scratch with the help of HTML and CSS. The website is somewhat similar to food delivery services. The website will automatically behave responsively according to different screen sizes.In this project, I have created a fully responsive website from scratch with the help of HTML and CSS. As a beginner, it was my first project but not last. The website we will create will be somewhat similar to food delivery services. Just a basic front-end website consisting of a home page then a services page like ordering and all details the user wants to find and then added clients info and In last added a contact form too. The website will automatically behave responsively according to different screen sizes.

## To make it responsive I made an individual phones.css file and added CSS like positioning and designing according to phone width. By differently style contact::before, contact-box, contact-box input, contact-box form, and contact-box label with the help of flexbox and CSS tools. Also used CSS variable too for a better understanding of code.
